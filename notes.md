# Notes â€” Week 6

## Historical observations

* The techniques I decided to use for identifying and surfacing interesting historical observations were [`wget`](https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/2/wget/), [OCR](https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/2/ocr/), and [Excel charts](https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/4/excel/).
  * `wget` was used to collect data for OCR.
  * OCR was used to further collect data from the images sourced with `wget`.
  * Excel charts were used to visualize the collected data.
  * With more time, I would have also used OpenRefine to facilitate cleaning the OCR data, but instead, I mostly did that manually or ignored issues. 
* I shared my results by making a static website and hosting it on GitHub Pages from my Week 6 repository. The website can be found [here](https://erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week6/).

## Details omitted from exit ticket

* In order to keep the exit ticket brief, I removed these two anecdotes that I wrote early on. They digressed too much from the point.

*****

> There's certainly a lot in this course that could be applied to linguistics or etymology (which I suppose is often a field within history).

*****

This one certainly could have been shortened, but I believe I summarized this well in the exit ticket by saying that the course left me with skills that would be applicable after the course is over. After all, isn't that what education is originally for?

> For example, one of the first things I'd like to do with the knowledge from this course is to archive and preserve the music on the niche Japanese music sharing website, Creofuga. Though I've only ever used this website once, I discovered that much of the music hosted on the website only appears Even though I had discovered the website only so recently, I came to learn that the website will shut down on June 30, 2020. There's a lot of unique, high-quality music tracks used as background music by Japanese YouTube personalities. Though a few people may have the file saved locally on their hard drive or in personal cloud storage, there is no guarantee that these files will be around forever, and when Creofuga shuts down, public access to these files may be lost forever if not archived.
