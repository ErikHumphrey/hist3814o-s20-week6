* My explorations and observations were based on the [Digital Archive of the Guatemalan National Police Historical Archive](https://ahpn.lib.utexas.edu/home), which Amalia Skarlatou Levi linked in [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/amaliasl/status/1245559883816189955).

* With more time, I would have also used OpenRefine to facilitate cleaning the OCR data, but instead, I mostly did that manually or ignored issues. 

> Reflect on Michelle Moravec’s own cycle of exploration and what that might imply for yours.

Moravec's cycle of exploration wasn't very relatable, so it did not have a large implication for my own cycle of exploration. However, she did mention that she had been studying links between feminist art and the woman's liberation movement for over 20 years. That sounds like a long time to work on such a narrow topic, so the implication it could have is that if during my own cycle of exploration, I make a grand enough discovery that really piques my interest, it could grow from a small, experimental study into an endeavour that spans half my career.

Moravec also compared two data visualization tools used by digital historians: Gephi and the Raw interface (RAWGraphs). Though I've only used Gephi, as far as I know, I've actually seen more visualizations created with RAWGraphs. I'd have to say that the RAWGraphs visualization seems more clear when it comes to visualizing networked data.
