# Exit Ticket

One of the first things I'd like to do with the knowledge from this course is to in some way archive and preserve the music on Creofuga. Though I've only ever used this website once, I discovered that much of the music hosted on the website only appears Even though I had discovered the website only so recently, I came to learn that the website will shut down on June 30, 2020. There's a lot of unique, high-quality music tracks used as background music by Japanese YouTube personalities. Though a few people may have the file saved locally on their hard drive or in personal cloud storage, there is no guarantee that these files will be around forever, and when Creofuga shuts down, public access to these files may be lost forever if not archived.
